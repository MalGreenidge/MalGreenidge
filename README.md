# Web developer 👨🏾‍💻, Fitness Enthusiast 🏋🏾‍♂️, Occasional Superhero 🦸🏾‍♂️

## 👋 Hey there! I'm Jamal, a web developer who's always tinkering with code and experimenting with new technologies.

- 🚀 My passion for building great websites and web apps has led me to work with a variety of clients, from small startups to large enterprises. I love the challenge of bringing their visions to life and delivering exceptional user experiences.

- 💻 When I'm not coding, you can usually find me playing around with new tools and frameworks, attending tech meetups and conferences, or mentoring aspiring developers.

- 🌱 Lately, I've been diving deep into Artificial Intelligence, and I'm excited to see where it takes me next. I'm always on the lookout for new projects and collaborations, so don't hesitate to reach out!

- 🎸 Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I'm usually staying active in the gym 🏋🏾‍♂️ or creating new dishes 🍛, I should start a cooking channel one day. Life's all about balance, right? 😉
